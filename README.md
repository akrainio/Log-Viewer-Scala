# Log-Viewer-Scala
Log viewing web app built using Scala and Play. Currently just a log parser that utilizes binary search on a single file.
Similar to my other [logapp](https://github.com/akrainio/logapp) project which was implemented in Python, however with some differences:
* Backend in Scala (with smarter use of object oriented features and immutability in mind)
* Play Framework instead of Web2Py
* Frontend in React or Vue.js (will attempt to use Scala.js instead of normal JavaScript)
